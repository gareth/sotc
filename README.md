## Limitations

* Occasionally, tokens won't update the first time they're sent out after a new script is selected.
  * They will correctly update after *any* other change is made to the grim, for example a shroud being added then removed.
* Off-script travellers won't display their role.
* **Large** scripts (more than 2x normal number of characters) can't be used with the extension.
  * There is a size limit to the amount of data that can be shared through Twitch extensions
* Tokens will not wait for the entire grim reveal but will be shown immediately once the game is ended
